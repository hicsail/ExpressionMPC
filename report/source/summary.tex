We implemented an optimized solution for computing shortest distances between nodes and vulnerable nodes in a network with many parties. We described two general techniques for doing this optimization: (1) performing the computation in stages some of which are local, such that each stage reduce the size of the input. For the network distance problem, we computed locally the network distance and weights of gateways of private networks. Then we computed the actual distances of these gateways together in MPC. In the third stage, we propagated the computed distances locally into the private networks to compute the distances of every node. (2) unrolling iterative algorithms into symbolic expressions that are optimized and then evaluated in MPC. We utilized problem-specific reductions that exploit the distributivity of min and addition as well as attempting to remove arguments by syntactic comparisons to reduce the number of min operators that must be evaluated. We believe these techniques can be applied to many problems in addition to network distance, causing the MPC solutions for more problems to become more efficient, simple, and therefore practical.
