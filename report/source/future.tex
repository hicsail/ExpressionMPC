We hope to apply the techniques discussed in the paper to more examples. We believe that organizing the computation in stages to reduce input size, as well as symbolically optimizing the computation are general enough to apply to a variety of problems. As long as the algorithms has a publicly available termination condition. In particular, we want to investigate minimum spanning trees and max-flow (details to be worked out). \\

We want to extend the library to include more expressions and operators, including support for conditionals and loops. As well as provide additional simplifiers for different use-cases. Many operators have algebraic properties that we can use to come up with useful reductions. \\

Finally, we hope to be able to transform our code into an all-purpose general library, which will allow the user to apply built-in protocol and simplifications without worrying about the underlying cryptographic, MPC, and symbolic optimization work. We would like to release the library's source code as well as making it easy to install using the python package index (pip). We hope this can make MPC more accessible to developers, and more efficient for wider application and use.
